# Ironic &middot;

This is a project to study library building and shipping in Rust.
Things I want to explore:

- Concurrency first design.
- Test and Benchmarks driven development.
- Scope of production ready ML applications.
    - Write classifiers/NNs.
    - Using [PyO3]() there is a possibility to run python code within rust.
- Scope of visualizations.
